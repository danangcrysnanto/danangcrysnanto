<!--
**danangcrysnanto/danangcrysnanto** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am Danang and I have extensive experiences working on the bioinformatics of whole genome sequencing data. Currently I work to integrate diverse genetic variations into a unified graph-based pangenome. With this, I extended functional genomics analysis to the genomic regions intractable with current standard analysis based on a linear genome. 

-	Professional experiences in bioinformatics data analyses, including Next generation sequencing, transcriptomic, graph-based genomics, genetic variant discovery, and basic genome assembly
-	Main programming languages: Bash (Unix/Linux), R/Bioconductor, Python
-	Data science: Tidyverse, Python Data Science (Numpy, Pandas, Jupyter)
-	Application development: Shiny, Flask
-	Computational pipelines: Snakemake 
-	Reproducible data: Git, Docker
-	High Performance Computing (HPC IBM LSF)
-	Others: Affinity Designer, Affinity Photo, Ms. Office, VIM, Sublime Text
