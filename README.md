### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am Danang and I have extensive experiences working on the bioinformatics of whole genome sequencing data. Currently I am working to apply graph analytic in order to integrate diverse genetic variations into a unified graph-based pangenome. With this, I extended functional genomics analysis to the genomic regions inaccessible with current standard of a linear genome and facilitate integrative multi-omics data analysis and vizualisation.
